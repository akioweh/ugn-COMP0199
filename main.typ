= Sequences of Functions

$(f_n)_(n=0)^infinity$ or $(f_n)$ denotes the sequence of functions where $f_n : A -> RR$ for all $n in NN$.

/ Sequence of Functions: An assignment of a function $f_n : A -> RR$ to each $n in NN$.

Hereafter, assume $A$ as the domain / target interval.

== Background

For numbers, the sequence $u_n$ tends to $l$ iff.
$
  forall epsilon > 0, exists N in NN : n > N => abs(u_n - l) < epsilon
$

A sequence of numbers $u_n$ is Cauchy if
$
  forall epsilon > 0, exists N > NN, forall m, n >= N : abs(u_m - u_n) < epsilon
$

A sequence is Cauchy iff. it is convergent (in _complete_ metric spaces).
Note that the Cauchy Criterion does not refer to the limit itself.


== Pointwise Convergence

If $lim_(n->infinity) (f_n (a))$ exists and is finite for all $a in A$, \
we can define the _limit function_ $f : x mapsto lim_(n->infinity) (f_n (x))$. \
$(f_n (a))_(n in NN)$ is said to *converge _pointwise_* towards $f$.

/ Pointwise Convergence: The sequence $(f_n)_(n in NN)$ converges pointwise to $f : A -> RR$ if
  $
    forall x in A, forall epsilon > 0, exists N in NN, forall n > N : abs(f(x) - f_n (x)) < epsilon
  $
  I.e., $forall x in A, f_n (x) -> f(x)$ as $n -> infinity$.


A sequence of functions $(f_n)$ is pointwise Cauchy if $(f_n (x))$ is Cauchy for all $x$. \
A sequence is pointwise Cauchy iff. it converges pointwise.


== Uniform Convergence

/ Uniform Convergence: The sequence $(f_n)_(n in NN)$ *converges _uniformly_* to $f$ on the interval $A$ if
  $
    forall epsilon > 0, exists N in NN, forall x in A, forall n > N : abs(f(x) - f_n (x)) < epsilon
  $
  I.e., $sup_(x in A) abs(f_n (x) - f(x)) -> 0$ as $n -> infinity$.

Uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence, to the same limit. (It is _stronger_.)

*Uniformity* is preserved: \
The limit $f$ continuous if all $f_n$ is continuous and $(f_n)$ converges uniformly.

*Integrals* are preserved: \
If $(f_n)$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $[a, b]$, then
$
  lim_(n->infinity) integral_a^b f_n (x) d x = integral_a^b f(x) d x
$

*Derivatives* are more complicated: \
If $(f_n (x_0))$ converges for some $x_0 in [a, b]$ and $(bold(f'_n))$ converges uniformly on $[a, b]$, then
$
  lim_(n->infinity) f'_n (x) = f'(x) quad quad ("for" x in [a, b])
$
...and the convergence of $(f_n)$ is also uniform.

Note: the uniform convergence on the sequence of derivatives converges the "shape" of the function, while the single-point convergence on the sequence itself asserts that the solution is uniquely well-defined. (Consider $f_n (x) = n + x$.)

= Series of Functions

$sum f_n$ denotes the series of functions, i.e., the sum of the sequence $(f_n)$.

== easy stuff

$f = sum f_n$ is more specifically $f : x mapsto sum_(n=infinity)^infinity f_n (x)$. \
Clearly, this (infinite) sum may be undefined.

The partial sums of a series is a sequence itself: $(sum_(k=0)^n f_k (x))_n$

$sum f_n$ *converges _pointwise_* on $A$ if the sequence of _partial sums_ converges pointwise on $A$.

/ Weierstrass M-Test: A test for determining whether a series of functions converges _normally_: \
  $sum f_n$ *converges _normally_* on $A$ \
  if $forall n in NN, forall x in A : abs(f_n (x)) <= M_n$ \
  for $M_n >= 0$, $sum M_n$ converges.

Note that _normal convergence_ implies *_uniform_* and *_absolute_ convergence*. \
The Weierstrass M-test may be seen as the Cauchy Criterion for uniform convergence. \
Furthermore, the $x$-dependence is eliminated by effectively taking the suprema:
$
  sup_x abs(sum_(n=N)^infinity f_n (x)) <= sum_(n=N)^infinity sup_x abs(f_n (x)) = sum_(n=N)^infinity M_n -> 0
$
- Does not help find the actual limit.
- Main tool used to test for uniform convergence.


== Power Series

/ Power Series: Series of functions of the form $ sum_(n>=0) a_n (x - b)^n $

- "centered" around $b$
- effectively an infinite polynomial

A power series always converges for certain $x$:
- trivially true for $x=b$,
- then there exists a convergent neighborhood around $b$.

/ Radius of Convergence: Some $r >= 0$ where a power series converges uniformly on any closed interval $A subset (b-r, b+r)$. \
  Divergence when $x in.not [b-r, b+r]$; unknown when $x = b plus.minus r$. \
  Can be infinite for series convergent everywhere.

/ D'Alembert's Ratio Test: A test to find the radius of convergence $r$ of a power series. \
  For some $sum_(n >= 0) a_n (x - b)^n$,
  consider the limit of the sequence of $a$-ratios $L = lim_(n -> infinity) abs(a_(n+1) / a_n)$:
  $
    r = cases(
      1 / L & "if" L != 0,
      infinity & "if" L = 0,
      0 & "if" L = infinity
    )
  $

I.e., convergence when $abs(x - b) < 1 / L$.


== Taylor Series

Taylor Series are a special case of power series. \
They converge (within the radius) to arbitrary functions.

For a function $f$ infinitely differentiable at $b in RR$, its Taylor Series centered at $b$ is
$
  sum_(n>=0) (f^((n))(b)) / n! (x - b)^n
$

- converges to $f$ in $(b - r, b + r)$
- Maclaurin Series are a special case where $b=0$

=== Well-known Functions

$
  e^x & = sum_(n>=0) x^n / n! && = 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ... &&\
  cos(x) & = sum_(n>=0) (-1)^n / (2n!) x^(2n) && = 1 - x^2/2! + x^4/4! - x^6/6! + ... &&\
  sin(x) & = sum_(n>=0) (-1)^n / (2n+1)! x^(2n+1) && = x - x^3/3! + x^5/5! - x^7/7! + ... &&\
  ln(1+x) & = sum_(n>=1) (-1)^(n+1)/n x^n && = x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + ... &quad quad& "for" abs(x) < 1, x = 1 \
  1 / (1 - x) & = sum_(n>=0) x^n && = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ... &quad quad &"for" abs(x) < 1 \
  arctan(x) & = sum_(n>=0) (-1)^n / (2n+1) x^(2n+1) && = x - x^3/3 + x^5/5 - x^7/7 + ... &quad quad &"for" abs(x) < 1 \
$

=== Approximations

The degree-$n$ Taylor polynomial of $f$ centered at $b$ is just the series truncated after $n+1$  terms:
$ T_n (x) = sum_(k=0)^n (f^((k))(b)) / k! (x - b)^k $

$f(x) approx T_n (x)$ for $x approx a$.

$R_n (x) = f(x) - T_n (x)$ is the tail of the terms in the series. \
There are numerous ways to express this sub-series beyond a simple summation.

/ Lagrange Form of the Taylor Remainder:
  $ R_n (x) = (f^((n+1)) (xi))/(n+1)! (x-b)^(n+1) $
  where $xi$ is a function of $x$ and is strictly between $b$ and $x$ (open interval).

The derivation of such a term that "captures" an entire series comes from the Mean Value Theorem; the heavy lifting is done by $xi$, which is a function itself and is _not_ computable, but is bounded and thus provides an upper bound for $R_n (x)$. Let $M = max_(xi in (b, x)) abs(f^((n+1)) (xi))$:
$ abs(R_n (x)) <= M / (n+1)! abs(x - b)^(n+1) $

Since $M$ is constant, we have, for $x -> b$:
- $R_n (x) approx abs(x - b)^(n+1)$, or more specifically,
- $R_n (x) = O((x - b)^(n + 1))$
- $R_n (x) = o((x - b)^n)$


#pagebreak()
= Linear Algebra

Assume $U$, $V$, and $W$ to be vector spaces. \
Assume vector spaces to be over the field of $RR$. \
Assume $+$ over functions be _pointwise addition_ -- $(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$. \

== easy stuff

/ Linear Independence: A subset $S = {v_1, ..., v_k} subset.eq V$ is linearly independent if \
  $sum_(i=0)^k a_i v_i = bold(0) quad ==> quad "all" a_i = 0$ \

Alternatively, the map $(a_1, ..., a_k) mapsto a_1 v_1 + ... + a_k v_k$ is injective.

/ Linear: A map $f: V -> W$ is linear iff. \
  *additivity* $f(u + v) = f(u) + f(v)$ and \
  *homogeneity* $f(lambda v) = lambda f(v)$ \
  are preserved (for arbitrary $u, v in V$ and $lambda in FF$). \

Additivity and homogeneity are commonly combined into $f(lambda u + v) = lambda f(u) + f(v)$.

/ Linear Map: A _homomorphism_ (see below) of a _vector space_.

/ Basis: (...of a vector space $V$) is a subset $B subset.eq V$ that is linearly independent and _spans_ $V$.

/ Direct Sum: A structure-_propagating_ Cartesian product#note-ref(<directsum>) with operations defined element-wise.
  Notated with "oplus" $plus.o$. \

  The above is more specifically an *external* direct sum; an *internal* direct sum _conditionally_ exists for #emph("sub")structures (of a common abelian-group-like structure) iff. their intersection is _trivial_; \
  For a structure $S$ with substructures $A$ and $B$, \
  $A plus.o B$ is well-defined#note-ref(<directsuminternal>) ("$A$ and $B$ are in direct sum") iff. $A inter B = {bold(0)}$. \

  / Decomposition Statements: The expression $S = A plus.o B$ asserts that $A$ and $B$ are in direct sum and that their sum is exactly $S$.
    $ S = A plus.o B quad <==> quad #quote([$A plus.o B$]) #text([*and*]) S = A + B $


#note(<directsuminternal>)[
  Note: with internal direct sums, the $A plus.o B$ notation has overloaded meanings: it denotes the same sum set as $A + B$ while simultaneously _asserting_ that $A inter B = {bold(0)}$.
]

Alternative definitions of internal direct sum: \
Substructures $A$ and $B$ of a common $S$ are in direct sum iff. every element of $T = A + B$ can be written in exactly one way as the sum of some $a in A$ and $b in B$. I.e.,
$ A plus.o B thick <==> thick forall t in T thick exists! (a, b) in A times B : t = a + b $
Again, $S = A plus.o B$ if also $T = S$.
A more general version, assuming $V = sum_i V_i$:
$
  V = plus.o.big_i V_i quad & <==> quad forall v in V, exists! (v_i)_i in plus.o.big_i V_i : v = sum_i v_i
$
Note that the second $plus.o$ denotes the external direct sum.\
The generalized intersection criteria: $plus.o.big_i V_i quad <==> quad forall i : V_i inter sum_(j!=i) V_j = {bold(0)}$.

#note(<directsum>)[
  #aside[
    Note: the _direct product_ is a structure-propagating Cartesian product; \
    the external direct sum is a direct product with the restriction that the resulting tuples can only have finitely many non-zero elements (which matters if there are infinite operands).
  ]
]

If $(u_1, ..., u_n)$ is a basis of $U$ and $(v_1, ..., v_m)$ is a basis of $V$, then $U plus.o V$ iff. $(u_1, ..., u_n, v_1, ..., v_m)$ are linearly independent. ($U$ and $V$ are in the same ambient space.) \
The internal direct sum is associative; the external direct sum is associative up to isomorphism.


/ Composition: For functions $f : B -> C$ and $g : A -> B$, \
  composition is a binary operator where $f compose g : A -> C, thick x mapsto f(g(x))$.

Composition verifies (for arbitrary functions $f, g, h$):
- associativity $f compose (g compose h) = (f compose g) compose h$,
- identity $f compose id = id compose f = f$, and
- distributivity (over $+$) \
  right $(f + g) compose h = (f compose h) + (g compose h)$ and \
  left $f compose (g + h) = (f compose g) + (f compose h)$ *only if* $f$ is _linear_.

#let End = math.op("End")

#aside[
  $(End(V), +)$ is an abelian group; \
  $(End(V), +, compose)$ is a ring. \
  $End(V) := {f : V -> V | f "is linear"}$; see below section on Endomorphisms.
]

Note that, for linear $f$ (so symmetric distributivity), we obtain the properties as matrix multiplication.

/ Dimension: The dimension of a vector space $V$, notated $dim V$, is the cardinality of (any) basis of $V$. \
  Note that the Steinitz exchange lemma guarantees any two bases of $V$ have the same cardinality. \
  $dim thin {0} = 0$.


For a function $f : A -> B$:
/ Injectivity: $forall x, y in A : f(x) = f(y) => x = y$ #h(4pt)i.e., $forall y in im f, exists! x in A : f(x) = y$
/ Surjectivity: $forall y in B, exists x in A : f(x) = y$ #h(29pt)i.e., $im f = B$
/ Bijectivity: Injectivity _and_ Surjectivity.


== Linear Maps

Assume $f, g, h$ to be linear maps, and by default $f : V -> W$.

/ Image: $im f := {f(v) | v in V} quad = f(V) subset.eq W$
/ Kernel: $ker f := {v in V | f(v) = bold(0)}$
/ Rank: $op("rank") f = dim im f$
/ Rank-Nullity Theorem: $op("rank") f + dim ker f = dim V$

Note that Rank is only defined for images of finite dimension, and \
Rank-Nullity Theorem assumes $V$ to have finite dimension too.

/ Kernel criterion for Injectivity: $f$ is injective iff. $ker f = {bold(0)}$.

Clearly, injectivity implies $dim W >= dim V$. (Can be proved using the Rank-Nullity Theorem.)

/ Matrix Column Rank criterion for Injectivity: $f$ is injective iff. for a matrix $M$ representing $f$, its columns are linearly independent. \

Clearly, surjectivity implies $dim V >= dim W$. (Can be proved using the Rank-Nullity Theorem.)

Note that any linear map can be made surjective trivially by setting its codomain ($W$) to its image.

/ Isomorphism: Both-way-_structure-preserving_ bijections.

Examples of structure properties to preserve: linearity, group operation. \
The _structure_ of vector spaces is linearity, and linear maps are, well, linear bidirectionally, so all *bijective linear maps are isomorphisms*.

Note#super("2"): The concept of _structure-preserving maps_ come from category theory, where categories explicitly define its such maps, called _morphisms_; vector spaces' morphisms are linear maps by definition, so bijective linear maps are isomorphisms :shrug:. \

Clearly, bijectivity implies $dim V = dim W$. \
Intuitive way to express bijectivity: $forall w in W, exists! v in V : f(v) = w$.

Two structures are _isomorphic_ iff. there exists an isomorphism between them. \
For $V$ and $W$ over the same field, $dim V = dim W$ iff. they are isomorphic.

Matrix representations of a bijection must be square. \
A matrix is invertible iff. it represents a bijection.

== Endomorphisms

/ Endomorphism: A map $f: V -> V$; same domain and codomain.
/ Automorphism: An endomorphism that is also an isomorphism.

For endomorphisms, *injectivity, surjectivity, and bijectivity are equivalent* (in finite dimension).

$f$ is bijective iff. it maps a basis to a basis.

=== Change of Basis

Consider an endomorphism $f$ of $V$ represented by matrix $M$ in the basis $B_1$.

$N = P^(-1) M P$ is the matrix representing $f$ in $B_2$ where
$P$ is a matrix whose columns are the coordinate vectors of $B_2$ in $B_1$. \

/ Transition Matrix: (aka. change-of-basis matrix) what $P$ is above.

Observe that if $P^(-1) M P = N$, then $P N P^(-1) = M$.



#pagebreak()
= Matrix Reduction

Assume $V$ denotes some finite-dimensional vector space over $FF$ ($= RR$ or $CC$, as specified). \
Assume $T : V -> V$ denotes some endomorphism of $V$. \
Assume $M in cal(M)_(n,n)$ is the matrix representation of any such $T$.

Observe that as $T$ is an endomorphism and $n = dim V$, we can always represent it as some square matrix.

== Abstract ahh Stuff

/ Invariant Subspace: (aka. stable subspace) $U subset.eq V$ is an invariant subspace under $T$ if $T(U) subset.eq U$. \
  I.e., $forall u in U : T(u) in U$.

Observe that $V$ and ${bold(0)}$ are always invariant subspaces under _any_ $T$; \
$ker T$ and $im T$ are always invariant subspaces under a given $T$. \
Note: it is also written "$U$ is #box[$T$-invariant]" for some subspace $U$ and transformation $T$.

#aside[
  Highly relevant to the concepts below: the #link("https://akioweh.com/shared/COMP0147#more-abstract-algebra-that-is-definitely-in-the-course-span-idabstract-algebraspan")[COMP0147 notes] on _cosets_ and _quotient groups_.
]

Assume $U subset.eq V$ a subspace.

/ Coset: For any $v in V$, the coset $v + U$ (or $[v]$ in _equivalence class_ notation) is the set ${v + u | u in U}$.

/ Quotient Space: A quotient (vector) space $V \/ U$ is a new vector space over the set of all cosets of $U$. \
  I.e., $V \/ U$'s carrier set is ${{v + u | u in U} | v in V}$. \
  Vector operations are defined as
  $[x] + [y] = [x + y]$ and
  $c[x] = [c x]$. \
  Observe that $dim (V \/ U) = dim V - dim U$.

Note: there are no conditions on $U$; one can form a quotient vector space from _any_ subspace.
(Due to addition being abelian and multiplication being external.)
This is contrary to general groups or rings, which require specific properties (normal subgroups or ideals) on the substructure.

/ Complementary Subspace: A subspace $W subset.eq V$ is complementary to $U$ iff. $V = U plus.o W$. \
  Construction from a Quotient Space: \
  Pick a basis ${[v_1], ..., [v_k]}$ for $V \/ U$. \
  Pick a $tilde(v)_i in [v_i]$ as a _representative_ for every coset in the basis. \
  $W = op("span"){tilde(v)_1, ..., tilde(v)_k}$ is a subspace complementary to $U$.

Complements to a subspace are generally *non-unique*, and a complementary subspace can be viewed geometrically as a _section_ of the corresponding quotient space.
However, the addition of an inner product (to define orthogonality) allows the construction of a unique, *canonical* complement $U^perp$. \
(See _Orthogonality_ subsection below.)

#aside[
  Observe that $W tilde.equiv (V \/ U)$ for any complement $W$.
  Specifically, the $W$-restriction of the projection map $pi|_W : W -> V \/ U$ is an isomorphism.

  The construction above produces a linear map $s : V \/ U -> V$ with $pi compose s = id_(V \/ U)$, called a _section_ (or _splitting_) of the projection $pi : V -> V \/ U$.
  Its image is the complement $W$.
  Given a choice of $s$, the map $(u,[v]) mapsto u + s([v])$ provides an _explicit_ isomorphism $U plus.o (V \/ U) tilde.equiv V$.
  Because this isomorphism relies on the arbitrary choice of representatives to build $s$, there is no _canonical_ isomorphism between $V$ and $U plus.o (V \/ U)$.
]

== Block Matrices

For a $T$-invariant $U$, one can construct, in a deliberate basis, a _block triangular_ matrix. \
Let $W$ be a subspace complementary to $U$.

Pick a basis $B_U = (u_1, ..., u_k)$ for $U$ and a basis $B_W = (w_1, ..., w_(n-k))$ for $W$. \
$B = (u_1, ..., u_k, w_1, ..., w_(n-k))$ is then a basis for $V$. (Since $V = U plus.o W$.)

Now, we construct a matrix $M$ for $T$ in $B$. \
Recall that a matrix can be constructed column-wise for $b in B$ as $T(b)$'s coordinates (in $B$):
$
  M =
  mat(
    arrow.t, , arrow.t, arrow.t, , arrow.t;
    T(u_1), dots.c, T(u_k), T(w_1), dots.c, T(w_(n-k));
    arrow.b, , arrow.b, arrow.b, , arrow.b
  )
  = mat(
    augment: #(vline: 1, hline: 1, stroke: 0.4pt),
    gap: #1em,
    A, B;
    0, C
  )
$

...where $A$ is a $k times k$ block; $0$ is a $(n-k) times k$ block of zeroes.

Observe:
- $A$ is the $B_U$-coordinates of $T(U)$
- $0$ is the $B_W$-coordinates of $T(U)$, which are zero since $U$ is invariant
- $B$ is the $B_U$-coordinates of $T(W)$
- $C$ is the $B_W$-coordinates of $T(W)$

Observe that $B$ will be zeroes if $W$ is _also_ invariant, yielding a _block diagonal_ matrix.

*Usefully*, $det(M) = det(A) times det(C)$ and $chi_M = chi_A times chi_C$.

== Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

/ Eigenvector: A nonzero vector $v in V$ is an eigenvector of some $T$ iff. there exists a scalar $lambda in FF$ where $T(v) = lambda v$.

/ Eigenvalue: The scalar $lambda$ above is the eigenvalue of $T$ _corresponding_ to the eigenvector $v$.

Other equations characterizing eigenvalues and eigenvectors wrt. matrix representations include
$
  (M - lambda I) v = bold(0) quad "or" quad v in ker (M - lambda I)
$
(See section below on the computational utility of these.)

An eigenvector's span is an invariant subspace where the associated endomorphism acts like a scaling: \
An eigenvector spans a 1-dimensional invariant subspace, and a linear transformation on 1-dimensional invariant subspaces can _only_ be a scaling.

/ Eigenspace: For a given eigenvalue $lambda$, we have its eigenspace $E_lambda = ker (M - lambda I) subset.eq V$. \
  Equivalently, $E_lambda = op("span"){v_1, ..., v_k}$ where ${v_1, ..., v_k}$ is a basis of eigenvectors for $lambda$ (and $k$ is the geometric multiplicity).

Observe that any $v in E_lambda \\ {bold(0)}$ is an eigenvector corresponding to $lambda$. \
Observe that ${"eigenspaces of" T} subset.neq {"invariant subspaces of" T}$. (Unequal in nontrivial cases.)

/ Geometric Multiplicity: The geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue $lambda$ of $M$, $gamma_M (lambda)$, is $dim E_lambda$. \
  This is the "physical" dimension of the associated eigenspace.

/ Algebraic Multiplicity: The algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue $lambda$ of $M$, $alpha_M (lambda)$, is its multiplicity as a root of $chi_M$ ($M$'s characteristic polynomial; see below).

/ Spectrum: The spectrum of some $T$ is the multiset of all its eigenvalues (with algebraic multiplicity).

/ Linear Independence of Eigenvectors: For _distinct_ eigenvalues $lambda_1, ..., lambda_k$, their corresponding eigenvectors $v_1, ..., v_k$ are linearly independent. \
  _Alternatively: Take a basis for each eigenspace; the union of all these bases, across distinct eigenvalues, is linearly independent._\
  This allows the construction of bases out of eigenvectors if we have enough eigenvalues.


=== Computing Eigenvalues

Assume $v in V != bold(0)$ and $lambda in FF$.

Derivation from $M v = lambda v$ to the _characteristic polynomial_:
$
                 M v & = lambda v \
      M v - lambda v & = bold(0) \
  M v - lambda (I v) & = bold(0) \
    (M - lambda I) v & = bold(0)
$

Observe that a given $lambda$ is a solution \
$<==>$ $ker (M - lambda I)$ is non-trivial \
$<==>$ $M - lambda I$ is not injective $<=>$ surjective $<=>$ bijective \
$<==>$ $M - lambda I$ is not _invertible_ \
$<==>$ $det(M - lambda I) = 0$. \
I.e., any $lambda$ that satisfies any statement above is an eigenvalue, and the set of all such solutions are the eigenvalues of the transformation represented by $M$.


/ Characteristic Polynomial: The characteristic polynomial $chi_M$ for matrix $M$ is
  $ chi_M (lambda) = det(M - lambda I) $
  The roots of $chi_M$ (expanding $det$ with the Leibniz formula) are exactly the eigenvalues of $M$. \

#aside[
  $
    chi_M (lambda) = det(lambda I - M) = det(
      mat(
        lambda, 0, ..., 0;
        0, lambda, ..., 0;
        dots.v, dots.v, dots.down, dots.v;
        0, 0, 0, lambda;
      )
      - M
    )\
    = lambda^n + a_(n-1) lambda^(n-1) + ... + a_2 lambda^2 + a_1 lambda + a_0
  $

  Aside#super[2]: there's a very subtle (and mostly insignificant) difference between $det(M - lambda I)$ and $det(lambda I - M)$.
  I refuse to elaborate further.
]

Observe that $T: V -> V$ cannot have more than $n = dim V$ eigenvalues (or eigenspaces). \
Observe that $chi_M$ has degree $n$. \
$0$ is a root of $chi_M$ iff. $det(M) = 0$


=== Computing Eigenvectors

Obviously, we just compute $ker (M - lambda I)$ for a given $lambda$ to obtain its eigenspace.


== Polynomials and Linear Maps

The characteristic polynomial computes eigenvalues. \
The roots and their multiplicity provide information on possible reductions (see below).

/ Complex vs Real fields: \
  Per the fundamental theorem of algebra, not all roots of the characteristic polynomial may be real. \
  For $FF = RR$, some $n times n$ matrix $M$ has $<= n$ eigenvalues. \
  For $FF = CC$, $M$ has exactly $n$ eigenvalues (counted with algebraic multiplicity).

Recall that polynomials in $RR$ factor into linear _and_ irreducible quadratic factors, while polynomials in $CC$ factor fully into linear factors.

If $FF = RR$, $chi_M$ factors into distinct irreducible quadratic terms $P_i$ and linear terms.
$
  chi_M (x) = a times P_1^(r_1)(x) times ... times P_k^(r_k)(x) times (x - lambda_1)^(s_1) times ... times (x - lambda_j)^(s_j)
$

If $FF = CC$:
$
  chi_M (x) = a times (x - lambda_1)^(r_1) times ... times (x - lambda_m)^(r_m)
$

/ Annihilating Polynomial: A polynomial $P$ over $FF$ is an annihilating polynomial for $M$ if \
  $P(M) = 0$.

/ Minimal Polynomial: The _monic_ polynomial $mu_M$ over $FF$ of least degree that annihilates $M$; $mu_M (M) = 0$

/ Cayley-Hamilton Theorem: Square matrices are annihilated by their own characteristic polynomials; $forall M in cal(M)_(i, i) : chi_M (M) = 0$ \
  Effectively, this means ${I, M, M^2, ..., M^n}$ is linearly dependent, and $chi_M$ itself demonstrates the exact dependence (via the coefficients).
  E.g., one can:
  - compute matrix inverses cheaply (by rearranging $chi_M (M)$)
  - represent high powers $M^k$ where $k >= n$ as some linear combination of the lower powers


== Matrix Reduction

Recall that a given matrix is just _one_ representation of a linear transformation and is implicitly associated with a chosen basis. \
Different bases thus correspond to different matrices that still represent the same transformation.

- We want diagonal matrices as they're computationally advantageous.
- While some $T$'s matrix $M$ in the standard basis may not be diagonal, it may have a diagonal representation under a different basis.
- Such a basis is precisely an _eigenbasis_ -- a basis consisting only of eigenvectors.

/ Eigenbasis: For a transformation $T$, an _eigenbasis_ is a basis of $V$ consisting only of eigenvectors of $T$.

/ Diagonalization: For a matrix $M$ and its transformation $T$, $M$ is _diagonalizable_ iff. an eigenbasis exists for $T$. \
  Constructing $P$ with the eigenbasis as columns, we obtain a change-of-basis matrix s.t. $D = P^(-1)M P$ is diagonal.

Further properties:
- the entries of $D$ are the eigenvalues of $M$ (with multiplicity)
- $M$ is diagonalizable iff. $mu_M$ splits into _distinct_ linear factors.
- $M$ is diagonalizable iff. $alpha_M (lambda) = gamma_M (lambda)$ for all eigenvalues $lambda$.
- Powers of $M$ are easy to compute: $M^k = P D^k P^(-1)$ (where $D^k$ is just diagonal entries raised to $k$).
- Similarly, for any analytic function $f$ (e.g., $e^M$): $f(M) = P f(D) P^(-1)$.

/ Kernel Decomposition Theorem: If the minimal polynomial of $T$ is split into pairwise coprime factors $p(x) = p_1 (x)^(r_1) ... p_k (x)^(r_k)$, then $V$ decomposes into a direct sum of the factors' kernels:
  $
    V = ker(p_1 (T)^(r_1)) plus.o ... plus.o ker(p_k (T)^(r_k))
  $

Following the complete factorization of the characteristic polynomial, we have...\
For $FF = RR$:
$
  V = ker(P_1^(r_1)(M)) plus.o ... plus.o ker(P_n^(r_k)(M)) plus.o ker((M - lambda_1 I)^(s_1)) plus.o ... plus.o ker((M - lambda_j I)^(s_j))
$
For $FF = CC$:
$
  V = ker((M - lambda_1 I)^(r_1)) plus.o ... plus.o ker((M - lambda_m I)^(r_m))
$
Note that every term and its power $r$ or $s$ directly correspond to the factorization of $chi_M$.

/ Generalized Eigenspace: For an eigenvalue $lambda$ with algebraic multiplicity $m = alpha_M (lambda)$, the generalized eigenspace is
  $ K_lambda = ker((M - lambda I)^m) $
  - Its elements are _generalized eigenvectors_.
  - $dim K_lambda = alpha_M (lambda)$ (always, unlike eigenspaces where $dim E_lambda <= alpha_M (lambda)$).
  - While the direct sum of eigenspaces $plus.o.big E_lambda$ may not span $V$, the direct sum of generalized eigenspaces always does (if $chi_M$ splits, e.g., over $CC$):
    $ V = plus.o.big_i K_(lambda_i) $

/ Triangularizable: A matrix $M$ is similar to an upper-triangular matrix iff. its characteristic polynomial $chi_M$ splits fully into linear factors over $FF$.
  - Since $CC$ is algebraically closed, all matrices over $FF = CC$ are upper-triangularizable.
  - A real matrix is triangularizable over $RR$ iff. all its eigenvalues are real. If it has irreducible quadratic factors, it cannot be triangularized (but can be block-triangularized with $2 times 2$ blocks).

/ Jordan Canonical Form:
  Every matrix whose characteristic polynomial splits is similar to a block-diagonal matrix of _Jordan blocks_:
  $
    J = mat(J_(d_1)(lambda_1), 0, dots.c, 0; 0, J_(d_2)(lambda_2), dots.c, 0; dots.v, dots.v, dots.down, dots.v; 0, 0, dots.c, J_(d_k)(lambda_k))
    quad "where" quad
    J_d (lambda) = mat(lambda, 1, 0, dots.c, 0; 0, lambda, 1, dots.c, 0; dots.v, dots.v, dots.down, dots.down, dots.v; 0, 0, dots.c, lambda, 1; 0, 0, dots.c, 0, lambda)

== Homogeneous Linear DEs

/ Homogeneous Linear Differential Equation: (HLDE) A linear differential equation of the form
  $ a_n y^((n)) + a_(n-1) y^((n-1)) + ... + a_1 y' + a_0 y = 0 $

/ Principle of superposition: The linear combination of any two solutions to a HLDE is also a solution. \
  This is due to the differential operator being linear.

The general solution to an $n$-th order HLDE is a linear combination of $n$ linearly independent solutions.

#aside[
  Let $D = dif / (dif x)$ be the linear differential operator. The HLDE can be written as:
  $ P(D) y = 0 $
  where $P(z) = a_n z^n + ... + a_1 z + a_0$ is the characteristic polynomial. \
  Clearly, solving the HLDE is equivalent to solving for $ker(P(D))$.

  / Spectral Mapping Theorem: For any $T$ and polynomial $P$, if $v$ is an eigenvector of $T$ with eigenvalue $lambda$, then $v$ is also an eigenvector of $P(T)$ with eigenvalue $P(lambda)$:
    $ T v = lambda v quad ==> quad P(T) v = P(lambda) v $

  Applying this to $T = D$, whose eigenfunctions are $y = e^(lambda x)$ with eigenvalue $lambda$ (since $D(e^(lambda x)) = lambda e^(lambda x)$), we get:
  $ P(D) e^(lambda x) = P(lambda) e^(lambda x) $

  Thus, if some $lambda$ satisfies $P(lambda) = 0$, then $P(D) e^(lambda x) = 0$, meaning the eigenfunction $e^(lambda x) in ker(P(D))$ is a solution.
]

The general solution is built from the roots of the characteristic polynomial $chi(lambda) = P(lambda) = 0$:

+ *Distinct Real Roots*: For each real root $lambda_i$, there is a solution $e^(lambda_i x)$.
+ *Repeated Real Roots*: For a real root $lambda$ with multiplicity $m$, the kernel contains the $m$ linearly independent solutions:
  $ e^(lambda x), thick x e^(lambda x), thick ..., thick x^(m-1) e^(lambda x) $
+ *Complex Conjugate Roots*: Since the coefficients $a_i$ are real, complex roots appear in conjugate pairs $lambda = a plus.minus i b$.
  - These yield complex solutions $e^((a plus.minus i b)x) = e^(a x) e^(plus.minus i b x) = e^(a x)(cos(b x) plus.minus i sin(b x))$.
  - Taking the real and imaginary parts (which are linear combinations) yields two real, linearly independent solutions:
    $ e^(a x) cos(b x) quad "and" quad e^(a x) sin(b x) $
  - If repeated with multiplicity $m$, multiply these by powers $x^k$ for $k < m$.

#aside[
  For complex conjugate solutions $y_1 = u + i v$ and $y_2 = u - i v$, their real and imaginary parts are linear combinations of the conjugate pair themselves:
  $ u = (y_1 + y_2) / 2 quad "and" quad v = (y_1 - y_2) / (2i) $
  By superposition, these linear combinations are also solutions, and they are guaranteed to be real-valued and linearly independent.
]

== Multivariate Functions

/ Fubini's Theorem: For a function $f : RR^2 -> RR$ that is continuous over a rectangle $X times Y$ ($X$ and $Y$ are intervals), the double integral can be computed as an iterated integral:
  $
    integral.double_(X times Y) f(x, y) dif(x, y) = integral_X (integral_Y f(x, y) dif y) dif x = integral_Y (integral_X f(x, y) dif x) dif y
  $
  This double-to-iterated conversion is valid for any shape of area as long as $f$ is continuous over it.

/ Gradient: A representation of the first derivative of a multivariate function. \
  For a function $f : RR^n -> RR$, the gradient of $f$ at some point $x = (x_1, ..., x_n) in R^n$ is the vector of partial derivatives:
  $ gradient f = vec((partial f) / (partial x_1), ..., (partial f) / (partial x_n)) $
  The gradient points in the direction of steepest ascent, and its magnitude is the rate of increase in that direction.

/ Hessian: A representation of the second derivative of a multivariate function. \
  For a function $f : RR^n -> RR$, the Hessian of $f$ at some point $x = (x_1, ..., x_n) in R^n$ is the matrix of second partial derivatives:
  $
    (bold(cal(H))_f)_(i,j) = (partial^2 f) / (partial x_i partial x_j) \
    bold(cal(H))_f = mat(
      (partial^2 f) / (partial x_1^2), (partial^2 f) / (partial x_1 partial x_2), ..., (partial^2 f) / (partial x_1 partial x_n);
      (partial^2 f) / (partial x_2 partial x_1), (partial^2 f) / (partial x_2^2), ..., (partial^2 f) / (partial x_2 partial x_n);
      dots.v, dots.v, dots.down, dots.v;
      (partial^2 f) / (partial x_n partial x_1), (partial^2 f) / (partial x_n partial x_2), ..., (partial^2 f) / (partial x_n^2)
    )
    = bold(upright(J))(gradient f)^top
  $

  The Hessian is used to analyze the local curvature of $f$ and classify stationary points.

== Stationary Points

If the second partial derivatives of $f$ are continuous near a point $x$, then
$(partial^2 f) / (partial x partial y) (x) = (partial^2 f) / (partial y partial x) (x)$. \
Consequently, the Hessian is symmetric for any $f$ with continuous second partial derivatives.

Classification of Stationary point $x$:
- $det(bold(cal(H))_f (x)) > 0$ \
  - If $(partial^2 f) / (partial x_1^2) (x) > 0$, then $x$ is a local minimum.
  - If $(partial^2 f) / (partial x_1^2) (x) < 0$, then $x$ is a local maximum.
- $det(bold(cal(H))_f (x)) < 0$ \
  $x$ is a saddle point.
- $det(bold(cal(H))_f (x)) = 0$ \

= Euclidean Spaces

Continue assuming $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over $FF = RR$ _or_ $FF = CC$; \
$u, v, w in V$ and $a, b in FF$.

== Inner Products

#let inner(a, b) = $chevron.l #a ""comma #b chevron.r$

#aside[
  The _canonical_ inner product is the dot product.
]

/ Inner Product: Additional structure on a $V$ as a binary operation $inner(dot, dot) : V times V -> FF$ satisfying:
  + Conjugate symmetry: $inner(v, w) = overline(inner(w, v))$
  + Linearity in the first argument: $inner(a v + b w, u) = a inner(v, u) + b inner(w, u)$
  + Positive-definiteness: $u != 0 ==> inner(u, u) > 0$


Observe that for $FF = RR$, $x = overline(x)$, so 1. is reduced to simple symmetry, and 2. extends to bilinearity. \
Also, for $FF = CC$, 1. implies that $inner(u, u) in RR$.

Implied properties:
- $inner(0, u) = inner(u, 0) = 0$
- $inner(u, u) = 0 <==> u = 0$ (A way to prove zero-ness of a vector)
- $inner(u, a v + b w) = overline(a) inner(u, v) + overline(b) inner(u, w)$; i.e., conjugate-linearity in the second argument (_sesquilinear_).

The inner product is a _symmetric positive-definite bilinear form_ for $FF = RR$, and a _positive-definite sesquilinear form_ for $FF = CC$.

/ Inner Product Space: A vector space equipped with an inner product.

/ Euclidean Space: An inner product space over $RR$.

/ Matrix Representation of Inner Product: A matrix $M in cal(M)_(n,n)$ represents the inner product $ inner(u, v) = u^top M v $ for $u, v in RR^n$ iff. $M$ is symmetric and positive-definite; i.e.,
  - $M^top = M$
  - $v != 0 ==> v^top M v > 0$

#aside[
  For $FF = CC$, replace "transposition" $x^top$ with "conjugate transposition" $x^dagger = overline(x)^top$ and these conditions remain true.
]

I.e., (in finite dimension), every inner product can be represented as a matrix, and every matrix satisfying said conditions represents an inner product.

$inner(dot, dot)_M$ denotes the inner product represented by $M$.

=== Infinite Dimension

Let's for example consider functions $f, g : RR -> RR$ on the interval $[a, b]$.

The _canonical_ inner product is
$
  inner(f, g) = integral_a^b f(x) g(x) dif x
$

#aside[
  Symmetry comes from the commutativity of multiplication; \
  linearity is inherited from that of integration; \
  positive-definiteness is inherited from $RR$ as a group.
]

== Norms

/ Norm: A function $norm(dot) : V -> RR$ satisfying:
  + Subadditivity (triangle inequality): $norm(v + w) <= norm(v) + norm(w)$
  + Absolute homogeneity: $norm(a v) = |a| norm(v)$
  + Positive-definiteness: $u != 0 ==> norm(u) > 0$

/ Induced Norm: Every inner product naturally _induces_ a norm via $ norm(u) = sqrt(inner(u, u)) $
  Note that the proof of the triangle inequality relies on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (below).

#aside[
  The other direction, i.e., whether a norm induces an inner product, requires the _parallelogram law_ $norm(u + v)^2 + norm(u - v)^2 = 2 (norm(u)^2 + norm(v)^2)$.
]

/ Euclidean Norm: The norm induced by the canonical inner product in Euclidean spaces. E.g., $ norm(vec(x, y)) = sqrt(inner(vec(x, y), vec(x, y))) = sqrt(vec(x, y) dot vec(x, y)) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) $

/ Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality: In any inner product space $V$, \
  $abs(inner(v, w))^2 <= inner(u, u) inner(v, v)$ \
  or, assuming the induced norm, \
  $abs(inner(v, w)) <= norm(v) norm(w)$.

Note that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is a consequence of the axioms of inner products; it is not an axiom itself, but it is a non-trivial result that helps prove, e.g., $sqrt(inner(u, u))$ is indeed a norm.

== Metrics

/ Metric (function): (Aka. distance) A function $d : A times A -> RR$ satisfying:
  + Symmetry: $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$
  + Positive-definiteness: $d(x, y) >= 0$ and $d(x, y) = 0 <==> x = y$
  + Triangle inequality: $d(x, z) <= d(x, y) + d(y, z)$
  for all $x, y, z in A$.

/ Metric Space: A structure $(A, d)$ where $d : A times A -> RR$ is a metric.

/ Induced Metric: Inner product spaces induce the metric $d(u, v) = norm(u - v)$.

#aside[
  Every inner product space is canonically a metric space using its induced norm and thus induced metric.
]

== Orthogonality

// Assume $V$ now to be an Euclidean space.

/ Orthogonality: For an inner product space, two vectors are orthogonal $v perp w$ iff. $inner(v, w) = 0$.

/ Generalized Pythagorean Theorem: For an inner product space with the induced norm $norm(dot)$, $ v perp w quad ==> quad norm(v + w)^2 = norm(v)^2 + norm(w)^2 $

/ Orthonormal Basis: A basis where vectors are pairwise orthogonal and of unit norm.

The coordinates of a vector in an orthonormal basis are easily computed via the inner product;
for a basis $(b_1, ..., b_n)$ and a vector $v$, $v = inner(v, b_1) b_1 + ... + inner(v, b_n) b_n$.

Every orthonormal family of vectors is linearly independent, and every finite-dimensional inner product space has an orthonormal basis.

/ Orthogonal Complementary Subspace: A given inner product subspace $W subset.eq V$ has a unique orthogonal complement (aka., the canonical complement)
  $
    W^perp = {v in V | inner(v, w) = 0 thick forall w in W}
  $

Clearly, \
$V^perp = {0}$ and ${0}^perp = V$ \
$V = W + W^perp$

For an orthonormal basis $(w_1, ..., w_k)$ of $W subset.eq V$, we can define the _orthogonal projection_ s.t.
$ P_W (v) = inner(v, w_1) w_1 + ... + inner(v, w_k) w_k $

Clearly, $P_W (v) in W$ and $v - P_W (v) in W^perp$.

/ Orthogonal Matrix: A matrix $M in cal(M)_(n, n)$ is orthogonal iff. its columns form an orthonormal basis. Alternatively, $M^top M = I$ or $M^top = M^(-1)$.

/ Real Spectral Theorem: For a real symmetric matrix $M$,
  - $M$ has a full eigenbasis
  - The eigenbasis can be chosen to be orthonormal

  Consequently, $M$ is orthogonally diagonalizable: there exists an orthogonal matrix $P$ s.t. \ $D = P^top M P$ is diagonal.

For *real symmetric matrices*,
- eigenvectors are orthogonal (and eigenvalues are real)
- positive-definiteness $<==>$ (strictly) positive eigenvalues (*useful property*)

This eigenvalue condition for positive-definiteness allows the _easier_ classification of matrices as inner products.

Recall that matrix representations of inner products are symmetric; \
they can thus always be diagonalized. \
Furthermore, positive eigenvalues allows normalization of an diagonal form into the identity matrix, so *every inner product can be represented as the canonical inner product in some basis*.

Advantages of an orthonormal basis:
+ Coordinates are easily computed via the inner product.
+ Inner products become the canonical dot product.
+ Orthogonal projections have a closed form (inner product).
+ Change of basis matrices between orthonormal bases are orthogonal.
+ A bunch more...

== Basics

/ Random Variable: A _measurable_ function $X : Omega -> T$. \
  #aside[
    $Omega$ belongs to a _probability triple_ $(Omega, cal(F), P)$ where the _probability measure_ $P: cal(F) -> [0, 1]$ assigns probabilities to _events_ $a in cal(F) subset.eq scr(P)(Omega)$.
    Naturally, an event, being a subset of outcomes, is considered to have occurred iff. the actual outcome is an element of it.

    Conceptually, a random variable maps abstract outcomes to concrete "numeric" values.
    Measurability ensures this mapping is well-behaved wrt. the structure of $cal(F)$ and $P$, and is analogous to continuity in standard analysis.

    Study _measure theory_ for further rigor.
  ]

  / Sample Space: $Omega$, the set of possible outcomes (symbolic).
  / Target Space: $T$, a measurable space (numeric repr. of outcomes).
    Often, $T = RR^n$.

  $X$ may be discrete or continuous.

#aside[
  It is important to realize that random variables can be freely _transformed_: \
  $Y = f(X)$ is a new random variable for any measurable function $f : T -> T'$; \
  and _combined_: \
  $Z = g(X, Y)$ is a new random variable for any measurable function $g : T times T -> T'$.

  Continuous functions on $RR^n$ are measurable.
  In fact, you'd rarely encounter a non-measurable function unless you're looking for one.
]

/ Probability Density Function: The PDF of a random variable is a function $f : T -> RR$ mapping a given target space outcome to its _relative_ probability. \
  A PDF $f : T -> RR$ must satisfy
  + $f(x) >= 0$
  + $integral_T f(x) dif x = 1$

PDFs are non-unique wrt. a given random variable. \
A random variable can be "reconstructed" from a PDF, also non-uniquely.

Concretely, a PDF specifies, via its integral, the probability of the random variable taking values within a given interval;
if a random variable $X$ has PDF $f$, then for any $a, b in T$ with $a <= b$,
$
  P(a <= X <= b) = integral_a^b f(x) dif x
$

Clearly, $P(X = a) = 0$ for any $a$, and the strictness of the inequalities does not matter.

/ Cumulative Distribution Function: The CDF of a random variable $X$ is the function $F : T -> RR$ s.t.
  $ F (x) = P(X <= x) $
  If $X$ has a PDF $f$, then also
  $ F (x) = integral_(-infinity)^x f(t) dif t $

The association between a random variable and its CDF is unique.

/ Inverse CDF: For a "distribution" $cal(X)$, we notate its inverse CDF as $cal(X)[c]$. I.e., \
  $cal(X)[c] = x <==> P(X <= x) = c$.

/ Expected Value: (Mean) For a random variable $X$ with PDF $f$, the expected value is
  $ mu = E[X] = integral_T x f(x) dif x $
  If $X$ is discrete, then $E[X] = sum_T x P(X = x)$.

#aside[
  Note that the expected value (and thus variance) can be defined for any random variable, even without a PDF, but this requires measure theory; for any random variable $X$ on $(Omega, cal(F), P)$,
  $ E[X] = integral_Omega X(omega) dif P(omega) $

  In the following section on statistics, this justifies the computation of means and variances on arbitrary statistical samples (which are assumed to be of some unspecified random variable).
]

/ Covariance: For random variables $X$ and $Y$ with means $mu_X$ and $mu_Y$ and a _joint_ PDF $f_(X,Y)$,
  $
    Cov(X, Y) & = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])] \
              & = E[X Y] - E[X] E[Y] \
              & = integral_T integral_T (x - mu_X)(y - mu_Y) f_(X,Y) (x, y) dif x dif y
  $

#aside[
  The "product" $X Y$ is a new random variable of the pointwise product of $X$ and $Y$, i.e., $(X Y)(omega) = X(omega) Y(omega)$ for all $omega in Omega$.

  But of course this doesn't directly yield useful computational formulas... so you should learn measure theory.
]

/ Variance: For a random variable $X$ with PDF $f$ and mean $mu$,
  $
    Var(X) & = Cov(X, X) \
           & = E[(X - E[X])^2] \
           & = E[X^2] - E[X]^2 \
           & = integral_T x^2 f(x) dif x - mu^2 = integral_T (x - mu)^2 f(x) dif x
  $

Covariance measures the linear dependence between $X$ and $Y$; \
variance measures the spread of variable around its mean.

#aside[
  / Law of the Unconscious Statistician: For a random variable $X$ with PDF $f$ and any function $g : T -> U$ ($U$ may be different target space), $ E[g(X)] = integral_T g(x) f(x) dif x $
    This follows from the definition of the expected value but is not immediately obvious. \
    This explains why $E[X^2] = integral_T x^2 f(x) dif x$ above.
]

/ Standard Deviation: $sigma(X) = sqrt(Var(X))$

If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $Cov(X, Y) = 0$.

/ Independence: $X$ and $Y$ are independent iff. $P(X = x inter Y = y) = P(X = x) P(Y = y)$ (for all $x, y$).

  For independent $X$ and $Y$, the joint PDF factorizes: $f_(X,Y) (x, y) = f_X (x) f_Y (y)$. \
  Also, $E[X Y] = E[X] E[Y]$ and thus $Cov(X, Y) = 0$.

Its sole parameter $k$ is called the _degrees of freedom_.

$ sum_(i=1)^k Z_i^2 ~ chi^2(k) $ where $Z_i ~^("iid") N(0, 1)$.

$chi^2(k) = op("Gamma")(alpha = k/2, theta = 2)$


== Multivariate

...joint probability distributions...

$ P(X = a, Y = b) = P(X = a inter Y = b) $

Joint distro of two continuous variables:
$ P(a <= X <= b, c <= Y <= d) = integral_a^b integral_c^d f_(X,Y) (x, y) dif y dif x $
for the _joint_ PDF $f_(X,Y)$ of $X$ and $Y$.

/ Marginal Distributions: Of a multivariate distribution, a single-variate distributions at some fixed values of all other variables. E.g. for the joint PDF $f_(X,Y)$,
  $
    f_X (x) & = integral_T f_(X,Y) (x, y) dif y \
    f_Y (y) & = integral_T f_(X,Y) (x, y) dif x
  $
  (Like a 2-d cross-section of the 3-d joint graph...)

/ Conditional Probabilities:
  $
    P(X <= x | Y = y) & = P(X <= x inter Y = y) / P(Y = y) \
                      & = (integral_(-infinity)^x f_(X,Y) (t, y) dif t) / (f_Y (y))
  $

== Useful Stuff

/ Law of Large Numbers: For a sequence of _independent and identically distributed_ (i.i.d.) random variables, the average converges to the individual expected value as the number of variables goes to infinity. \
  Formally, if $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ are i.i.d. with expected value $mu$, then
  $ P(lim_(n -> infinity) overline(X) = mu) = 1 $
  where $overline(X) = 1/n (X_1 + ... + X_n)$.

/ Central Limit Theorem: (CLT) For i.i.d.s $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ with mean $mu$ and _finite_ variance $sigma^2$,
  $ lim_(n -> infinity) overline(X) ~ N(mu, sigma^2 \/ n) $
  where $overline(X) = 1/n (X_1 + ... + X_n)$.

We consider the approximation valid for $n >= 30$.

= Statistics

Statistics can be seen as the physical manifestation of associated theoretical concepts in probability.

#aside[
  Interesting: see _frequentist_ vs _Bayesian_ interpretations of probability.
]

/ Model: (Statistical Model) The probability distribution (or family of distributions) from which a sample is drawn (aka. the _underlying parent distribution_). \

When describing a physical process, the model is almost always an assumption.

/ Sample: (Random Sample) A sample $bold(X)$ of size $n$ is a sequence of random variables $bold(X) = (X_1, ..., X_n)$ drawn from the model. \
  A _realized_ sample is an observation of $bold(X)$, i.e. a sequence of real values $bold(x) = (x_1, ..., x_n)$ where $x_i$ is the observed realization of $X_i$.

/ Simple Random Sample: (SRS) A sample where $X_i$ are i.i.d. \
  E.g., a sample drawn uniformly at random from the model, with replacement.

Clearly, the CLT can be used to approximate the mean of SRSs.

== The Normal Distribution

The normal distribution frequently appears in various statistical processes. \
Different processes may produce different normal distributions, but they can be normalized to the _standard_ normal distribution $N(mu = 0, sigma^2 = 1)$.

/ Normalization: For some $X ~ N(mu, sigma^2)$, the normalized variable $Z = (X - mu) / sigma ~ N(0, 1)$.

)

== Parameter Estimation

To use a statistical model to represent a physical random process, we must estimate its defining parameters $theta$ from sample data.
E.g., under a normal model, we estimate the mean $mu$ and variance $sigma^2$; under an exponential model, we estimate the rate $lambda$.

#aside[
  If a realized sample of $n$ observations is drawn from the distribution of one random variable $X$, we can model the sample prior to realization as a random sample: a sequence of i.i.d.s $X_1, ..., X_n$ sharing the same distribution as $X$. \
  Per the CLT, the distribution of the sample mean $overline(X)$ is approximated by a normal distribution (for sufficient $n$). \
  It is therefore useful to estimate the $mu$ and $sigma^2$ of an arbitrarily-distributed variable $X$, as these two parameters directly dictate the behavior of the sample mean even when $X$ itself is not normal.
]

/ Statistic: Any function $T$ that maps a random sample $bold(X)$ to a _statistic_ (a new random variable). \
  When evaluated on a realized sample, $T(bold(x))$ yields a real value. \

E.g., the sample mean estimator $overline(X) = 1/n sum_i X_i$ is a random variable, while the realized sample mean $overline(x) = 1/n sum_i x_i$ is a fixed number.

/ Estimator: An estimator $T(bold(X))$ is a statistic used to estimate a parameter $theta$ of the underlying distribution.
  The realized value $hat(theta) = T(bold(x))$ is an *estimate*.

/ Bias: An estimator $T(bold(X))$ for $theta$ is unbiased iff. $E[T(bold(X))] = theta$.

E.g. the sample mean estimator $overline(X)$ is an unbiased estimator of the true mean $mu$ since $E[overline(X)] = mu$.

/ Sampling Distribution: The sampling distribution of an estimator $T(bold(X))$ is its probability distribution as a random variable. \
  Equivalently, it is the distribution of realized estimates $T(bold(x))$ across all possible realizations of the random sample $bold(X)$.

Knowledge of the sampling distribution of an estimator allows us to e.g. compute _confidence intervals_ for the estimate, and thus is a crucial part of statistics.

Note that statistics and their sampling distributions are usually tied to the sample size $n$.

#aside[
  *Normality Assumption*: The exact sampling distributions of the estimated mean (Student's $t$) and variance ($chi^2$) below assume a normal model, i.e., $X_i ~^("iid") N(mu, sigma^2)$.
  For non-normal models, these exact finite-sample results do not hold, although the CLT does permit the normal approximation of the sample mean for large sample sizes.
]

=== Mean

/ Mean Estimator: The canonical sample mean estimator is the arithmetic mean:
  $
    overline(X) = 1/n sum_(i=1)^n X_i
  $
  It is *unbiased*:
  $
    E[overline(X)] = E[1/n sum_(i=1)^n X_i] = 1/n sum_(i=1)^n E[X_i] = 1/n (n thin E[X]) = 1/n (n mu) = mu
  $

Also, $Var(overline(X)) = E[(overline(X) - mu)^2] = sigma^2 / n$.

Recall that in general, $E[overline(X)] = mu$ and $Var(overline(X)) = sigma^2 / n$. \
Under the parent normality assumption $X_i ~^("iid") N(mu, sigma^2)$, the exact sampling distribution of the sample mean is
$
  overline(X) ~ N(mu, sigma^2 \/ n)
$
which can be standardized:
$
  Y = (overline(X) - mu) / (sigma \/ sqrt(n)) = sqrt(n) (overline(X) - mu) / sigma ~ N(0, 1)
$
...and rearranged to yield the realized $(1-alpha)$ confidence interval for $mu$:
$
  [ overline(x) + z[alpha/2] sigma/sqrt(n) thin, thick overline(x) + z[1 - alpha/2] sigma/sqrt(n) ] quad "or" quad
  [ overline(x) - abs(z[alpha/2]) sigma/sqrt(n) thin, thick overline(x) + abs(z[alpha/2]) sigma/sqrt(n) ]
$
($z[c]$ is the inverse CDF of the standard normal distribution.)

/ Studentized Mean: Often, the true variance $sigma^2$ required in the above interval is unknown.
  If $sigma$ is substituted with the unbiased sample standard deviation $S$, the resulting statistic instead follows Student's t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom:
  $
    Z = sqrt(n) (overline(X) - mu) / S ~ t(n-1)
  $

#aside[
  Because we are using an estimator $S$ instead of a constant $sigma$, $Z$ is the quotient of a normal distribution (the mean estimator) and the square root of a chi-squared distribution (the variance estimator, see below), which results in a $t$-distribution.
  The $t$-distribution exhibits heavier tails than the normal distribution to account for this uncertainty in the variance.
]

Using this exact sampling distribution, the $(1-alpha)$ realized confidence interval for $mu$ is now
$
  [ overline(x) - abs(t_(n-1)[alpha/2]) s/sqrt(n) thin, thick overline(x) + abs(t_(n-1)[alpha/2]) s/sqrt(n) ]
$
where $overline(x)$ and $s$ are the mean and standard deviation of the realized sample.

Clearly, $t_(n-1)[alpha/2] >= z[alpha/2]$, so the realized confidence intervals are wider when the variance is also estimated.

=== Variance

/ Variance Estimator: The estimator for sample variance following the discrete formula is
  $
    tilde(S)^2 = 1/n sum_(i=1)^n (X_i - overline(X))^2
  $

  However, $tilde(S)^2$ is a *biased* estimator of the population variance $sigma^2$ (and thus called _uncorrected_):
  $
    E[tilde(S)^2] = #text[...complex derivation...] = (n-1)/n sigma^2
  $

#aside[
  The bias arises because the sample mean $overline(X)$ is used in place of the unknown true population mean $mu$.
  The sample observations $X_i$ are closer to their own sample mean $overline(X)$ than to the true mean $mu$, causing $tilde(S)^2$ to systematically underestimate the true variance.
]

/ Bessel's Correction: $tilde(S)^2$'s bias is corrected by scaling by $n / (n - 1)$, yielding the *unbiased sample variance estimator*:
$
  S^2 = n / (n - 1) tilde(S)^2 = 1 / (n - 1) sum_(i=1)^n (X_i - overline(X))^2
$

Now,
$
  E[S^2] = n / (n - 1) E[tilde(S)^2] = n / (n - 1) ( (n - 1) / n sigma^2 ) = sigma^2
$

We denote the corresponding realized estimates (calculated from a realized sample $bold(x)$) as $tilde(s)^2$ and $s^2$.

Under the parent normality assumption ($X_i ~^("iid") N(mu, sigma^2)$), the sampling distribution of $S^2$ is related to the chi-squared $chi^2$ distribution. \
Specifically, the standardized statistic $K$ follows a $chi^2$ distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom:
$
  K = ((n - 1) S^2) / sigma^2 = 1 / sigma^2 sum_(i=1)^n (X_i - overline(X))^2 ~ chi^2 (n - 1)
$

(Note that $chi^2$ is asymmetric.) \
For a confidence level of $1 - alpha$, we have:
$
                        P(chi^2_(n-1)[alpha/2] <= ((n - 1) S^2) / sigma^2 <= chi^2_(n-1)[1 - alpha/2]) & = 1 - alpha \
  P( ((n - 1) S^2) / (chi^2_(n-1)[1 - alpha/2]) <= sigma^2 <= ((n - 1) S^2) / (chi^2_(n-1)[alpha/2]) ) & = 1 - alpha
$

For a realized sample with unbiased variance estimate $s^2$, the confidence interval for $sigma^2$ is
$
  [ ((n - 1) s^2) / (chi^2_(n-1)[1 - alpha/2]) thin, thick ((n - 1) s^2) / (chi^2_(n-1)[alpha/2]) ]
$

To obtain the realized confidence interval for the standard deviation $sigma$, we simply take the square root of the bounds.

== Hypothesis Testing

#aside[
  Hypothesis testing provides a structured statistical framework to make decisions about a model parameter using sample data.

  A _null hypothesis_ making a claim about a parameter is stated, then a test statistic is computed from a realized sample, and finally a $p$-value is calculated to quantify the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis under the model's assumed sampling distribution.
]

=== Procedure

#aside[
  The hypothesis testing framework operates on top of the model's assumptions.
  The hypotheses make assertions about the parameter $theta$ itself, while the model provides the reference sampling distribution of the test statistic under $H_0$ (which is core to calculating $p$-values used to draw conclusions). \
  While a rejection of $H_0$ technically rejects the _combination_ of the hypothesis and the model, the framework assumes the model correct and attributes the rejection to $H_0$ alone.
  Similarly, failing to reject does _not_ validate the model.
]

Let $theta$ be the parameter of interest.
Note that we do not know the true value of $theta$.

/ Null Hypothesis: ($H_0$) The baseline or default assumption that $theta = theta_0$, an assumed value.

/ Alternative Hypothesis: ($H_1$) A claim contradicting $H_0$ that we wish to seek statistical evidence for.
  There are three common forms of $H_1$:
  - *Two-tailed*: $theta != theta_0$ (true $theta$ is different from $theta_0$)
  - *Left-tailed*: $theta < theta_0$ (true $theta$ is smaller than $theta_0$)
  - *Right-tailed*: $theta > theta_0$ (true $theta$ is larger than $theta_0$)

/ Test Statistic: An estimator $T$ for $theta$ whose sampling distribution under $H_0$ is (completely) specified by the model.
  Its evaluation on a realized sample yields an observed value $t_0 = T(bold(x))$.

#aside[
  E.g., for a normal model ($X_i ~^("iid") N(mu, sigma^2)$) with unknown variance, the appropriate test statistic for the mean $H_0: mu = mu_0$ is
  $
    T(bold(X)) = (overline(X) - mu_0) / (S \/ sqrt(n)) = sqrt(n) (overline(X) - mu_0) / S ~ t(n-1) quad text("under") H_0
  $

  Evaluating this on our realized sample yields the observed value $t_0 = sqrt(n) (overline(x) - mu_0) / s$.
]

/ $p$-value: The probability, under $H_0$, of obtaining a test statistic $T$ at least as extreme as the observed value $t_0$.
  Clearly, this depends on the type of $H_1$:
  - For *two-tailed*: $p = P(abs(T) >= abs(t_0))$
  - For *left-tailed*: $p = P(T <= t_0)$
  - For *right-tailed*: $p = P(T >= t_0)$

#aside[
  E.g., (continuing with the above example)
  Under the Student's $t(n-1)$ distribution of $T$ under $H_0$:
  - Two-tailed: $p = 2 P(T >= abs(t_0))$ (by symmetry of the $t$-distribution)
  - Left-tailed: $p = P(T <= t_0)$
  - Right-tailed: $p = P(T >= t_0)$
]

/ Significance Level: ($alpha$) The maximum tolerated probability of a false positive (i.e., type I error); used to determine the threshold for rejecting $H_0$.
  - $p < alpha$: we *reject $H_0$* in favor of $H_1$ (the observed effect is statistically significant).
  - $p >= alpha$: we *fail to reject $H_0$* (we cannot conclude anything significant; we do not "accept" $H_0$, but rather find insufficient evidence to discard it).

$alpha$ is commonly 5%.



== Bootstrapping

#aside[
  Traditional statistical inference relies on parametric assumptions (e.g., population normality) or large-sample asymptotics (the CLT) to analytically derive the sampling distribution of an estimator.
  However, in many practical scenarios, these models fail:
  - The underlying distribution may be highly skewed, multi-modal, or simply non-normal (e.g., alcohol consumption or wealth distributions).
  - The sample size $n$ may be too small for asymptotic theorems (like the CLT) to provide a reliable approximation.
  - Sourcing additional physical samples may be impossible or prohibitively expensive (e.g., a one-off historical survey).
]

Bootstrapping provides a computational method to estimate the sampling distribution of any statistic directly from a single observed sample. \
The only assumption is that the observed sample is _representative_ of the underlying distribution.


=== Bootstrap Algorithm

Given:
- An unknown population distribution with a true parameter of interest $theta$.
- An observed sample $bold(x) = (x_1, ..., x_n)$ of size $n$.
- An statistic $T(bold(X))$ estimating $theta$, yielding an initial estimate $hat(theta) = T(bold(x))$.

Repeat $B$ times:
+ Draw a uniform random sample $bold(x)^* = (x_1^*, ..., x_n^*)$ of size $n$ from $bold(x)$ uniformly *with replacement*.
+ Compute the statistic $hat(theta)^* = T(bold(x)^*)$.

This yields a sequence of $B$ bootstrap estimates: $hat(theta)^*_1, hat(theta)^*_2, ..., hat(theta)^*_B$. \
As $B -> infinity$, the empirical distribution of the bootstrap estimates converges to the true sampling distribution of $hat(theta)$, allowing statistical inference (e.g. confidence intervals) without parametric assumptions.

=== Constructing Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

Under the *Percentile Bootstrap Method*, we can construct a $(1 - alpha)$ confidence interval for $theta$ directly from the empirical distribution of our bootstrap estimates:
+ Sort the $B$ bootstrap estimates $hat(theta)^*_i$ in increasing order.
+ Find the lower percentile index at $alpha/2$ and the upper percentile index at $1 - alpha/2$.
+ The resulting confidence interval is
  $
    [ hat(theta)^*_([B thin alpha / 2]), hat(theta)^*_([B thin (1 - alpha / 2)]) ]
  $
